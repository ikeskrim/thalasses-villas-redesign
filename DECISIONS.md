# Decisions

Owner decisions, recorded the moment they are relayed. See `CONVENTIONS.md` §19.

This file exists because of a defect, not a process improvement: the owner
approved a design direction and that approval lived only in a chat window, so a
later session read the register of a brief and built against a different
aesthetic. **A decision that is not in the repository is not a decision anyone
after you can act on.**

## D-001 · Direction F, "The Cretan Hotel" — the production direction

**Decided:** September 2026, by the owner.
**Relayed to the repository:** this entry.
**Status:** in force.

Direction F is the production direction. The dense, warm, credible luxury-hotel
homepage: Book Now pinned top-right, a slow hero, villa cards carrying facts and
two buttons, experiences grouped by kind, weddings, distances, a press wall, and
a real hotel footer with the operating licence in it.

**Wanted on top:** more cinematic, and unusual-but-luxurious motion, per
`MOTION-DIRECTIVE.md`.

### What that settles

- `/` is Direction F. The chooser and the four other candidate looks are removed
  from the build; their record and their findings stay in `SESSION-REPORT.md`
  and `RE-SKIN-DIRECTIVE.md`.
- Aesthetic work is measured against **this** direction. Aman-register
  minimalism, oversized display type and type-led layouts were the earlier
  candidates and are no longer the target, however strongly a later brief's
  language leans that way.
- Motion is calibrated by the weirdness dial in `MOTION-DIRECTIVE.md`:
  conversion-critical and dense zones stay at Level 1, narrative zones at Level
  2, and no more than three Level-3 set-pieces on the page.

### What it does not settle

- The Greek locale. `/el` remains unpublished; the corpus is `copyStatus:
  "draft"` with 371 questions awaiting the owner's native review.
- The fourteen quarantined non-property frames (see
  `content/flagged-quarantine.json`). Still owner-pending.
- The section quote, the press wall beyond its single verified mention, and the
  group's sister properties. All still labelled slots.

## D-002 · Tier B-Experiences stock — sourced, placed, and awaiting the owner's veto

**Decided:** September 2026, by the owner: free-licence sources only
(Pexels/Unsplash class), zero budget, nothing purchased, nothing generated;
source the fourteen unphotographed experiences under the Tier B-Experiences
rule; reject rather than stretch; the owner reviews every placed frame on the
live page and may veto any.
**Relayed to the repository:** this entry, `content/image-sources.md` §7,
`content/experience-stock.json`.
**Status:** placed — **owner review pending.**

### What was placed (nine)

boat-trip · scuba-diving · jet-ski-safari · hiking · jeep-safari ·
exclusive-tour · massage · therapist · wine-production. Each with file, source
URL, photographer, licence wording and retrieval date in
`content/experience-stock.json`, and each rendered only on its experience card,
the register, and its own detail page — never in a Tier A context, which
`tests/flagged.spec.ts` asserts.

### What was not (five), and why

running · bike-tours · quad-safari · personal-trainer · private-helipad. The
reasons are printed on the cards themselves and tabled in
`content/image-sources.md` §7. Two of these — quad-safari and personal-trainer —
were accepted by their verifiers and overruled on sight in this session; the
overruling is recorded there with the reason, so the owner can disagree with it.

### What the owner decides next

- **Veto any of the nine** on the live page. Removing one is a single line in
  `content/experience-stock.json` and a regenerate; the card returns to its
  typographic treatment.
- **The twelve inherited `pending-licence` frames** stay out until a licence is
  produced. They were found still rendering as detail-page heroes and are now
  off every surface.

### Still open, not guessed

Whether the chauffeur and the helipad should have their own experience cards
rather than being woven into the Discover Crete prose. They are placed, not
carded, until the owner says otherwise.
