# Session report

**Read this first. It is written at HEAD and updated as each task lands, so it
is the truthful position — not a plan, not a memory.**

Last updated: after `overnight/9`.

**A correction worth naming.** The previous message closed with "Continuing with
Task 3." That was intent, not work: the turn ended before any of it happened, and
the next queue arrived assuming Tasks 3–19 were behind us. Reading HEAD is what
caught it. This is the same discipline as §14 — the repository is the source of
truth, not a session's account of itself — applied to my own reporting rather
than to someone else's.

### Routes that exist at HEAD

`/` · `/en/the-estate` · `/en/villas/{thoi,persi,eeanthe,melia,pueblo}` ·
`/en/experiences` + 21 detail pages · `/en/weddings` · `/en/location` ·
`/en/careers` · `/en/contact` · `/en/terms` · `/styleguide`

Not built: gallery, 404, `/el`. No redirect map wired, no sitemap or robots, no
axe integration, no walkthrough videos.

## What is live and verifiable

- **Pipeline:** auto-deploys on every push to `main`, team `domisi`,
  protection off, `noindex` on by design. See `DEPLOY.md`.
- **Tests:** 197 passing, 1 skipped. Scan, typecheck, lint clean at HEAD.
- **Direction D** is the site's language: light limestone ground, display capped
  at 96px, `--section-y` rhythm, one idea per viewport, one or two dark
  interludes per page.

## Defaults taken without waking the owner

| Decision | Reasoning |
|---|---|
| Breakfast omitted from "your stay includes" | The registry states three services and breakfast is not among them. **Since confirmed by the owner: it carries an extra charge.** The default was right and is now permanent (T-245) |
| Villa page spends one dark interlude, on the generosity list | D permits one or two per page; the template had none and read flat over a long scroll |
| Estate figures moved to the shared `Ledger` | The estate and the villas now print figures through one component instead of two |
| Scroll odometer retired | A gadget; D's brief is explicit that confidence comes from timing and whitespace |

## Defects found and fixed this run

1. **Every primary CTA on the site was 2.27:1** and had been since the elevation
   pass. `.micro` sets a colour, globals imports partials at the top, so its rule
   cascaded after `.btn-primary`'s at equal specificity and won. (T-242)
2. **The estate enquiry CTA was 1.43:1** — same family, via `.on-dark .micro`.
   Found by the contrast guard within an hour of writing it. (T-247)
3. **Five villa plates rendered as empty rectangles** — raw CDN URLs passed to
   `next/image` instead of through `localImage`, which also bypasses the
   ruled-off list. (T-235)
4. **The hero scrim left ~0.28 alpha across the copy band**; limestone read
   ~1.6:1 over a bright sky. Recomputed to 0.72. (T-236)
5. **The credential scanner reported clean on a real `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`** — its
   generic pattern required quotes and an env assignment has none. (T-237)
6. **The D rebuild silently dropped the T-212 detail rows.** My own regression,
   caught in the same session. (T-243)

**The cause behind 1 and 2 is now fixed, and the fix was falsified.** They were
one family with T-217. `@layer` puts components above the typographic register,
so a register rule can no longer beat a component rule by import order. All
three specificity patches were then **deleted**, and the contrast guard still
passes on eight routes — the layer order is what holds the colours, not the
patches. (T-253, CONVENTIONS §16.)

## Waiting only on the owner

- T-212 — Villa Pueblo's bathroom detail, view, distance, and a `specsConfirmed` flag
- The geographic scope of the "only seafront villas with helipad" claim
- The hero sub-line, shipping as a working default
- The eight beach distances
- The hero MP4
- The three quarantined frames in `qa/curation/owner-review/`
- The Google Cloud console: restrict or rotate the legacy Maps key (alert #1 stays open until confirmed)
